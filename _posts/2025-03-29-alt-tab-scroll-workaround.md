I got the issue that when I scroll in vscode then switch 
 to chrome or brave via Alt+Tab and start to scroll then the last scrolling actions that were done in vscode got
 re-applied to chrome resulting in instant jump of the page. Was very annoying.
Fixed it by installing [Alt+Tab Scroll Workaround](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5282/alttab-scroll-workaround/)
